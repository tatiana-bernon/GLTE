# GLTE- G(ideon)IVE ~~LIQUOR~~ L(ewis)OVE T(atiana)O E(velyn)VERYONE

> Give ~~Liquid~~ Love To Everyone (GLTE for short also representative of the first name initial of the 4 amazing humans who worked together on this concept and project.) was born on a festive day where the EDA cohort I studied with were to celebrate the end of Phase2 of the Bootcamp. With this vibe in mind for one of our friday projects we decided to create an online remake of the Red, Black,High. Low card drinking Game
